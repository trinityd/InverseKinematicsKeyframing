# InverseKinematicsKeyframing
An interactive 3D C++ OpenFrameworks project that implements n-joint IK and keyframe animation

See the poster or presentation video for a walkthrough of the project. To build, make a new OpenFrameworks project using the ofxGui and ofxAssimpModelLoader addons and replace the resulting src folder with the src folder in this repo.
